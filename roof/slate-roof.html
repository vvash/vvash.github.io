                        <p> During a fairly aggressive seizure of the market by foreign manufacturers of new roofing
                            Materials slate, as a cheap material and the most common, underwent active
                            He was accused of all mortal sins, clearly hinting that such material
                            Is no longer a place on our roofs. </p>

                        <p> Indeed, asbestos as a material is harmful to the body, but not everything is as bad as loudly about
                            This is shouted out. </p>

                        <p> What is a slate? </p>

                        <p> To begin with, slate is a roofing material, and nobody can make kitchen tables out of it.
                            Is going to. We are separated from it by several layers of roofing carpet, as we see, it does not
                            Is in direct contact with a person and is unlikely to harm the health. </p>

                        <p> By itself, asbestos is harmful just as bad as any fiber of organic and
                            Of inorganic origin. If we eat it, nothing will happen, but if
                            Day to day we will inhale a huge number of long and thin fibers, they will accumulate in the lungs
                            And will cause harm to health, but such a dangerous concentration is possible only in the places of extraction
                            Or dry processing of asbestos, and even if there is compliance with all safety standards,
                            Avoid fatal consequences. </p>

                        <p> Moreover, the Americans found out that in a house covered with asbestos slate and during construction
                            Which used other asbestos containing materials, a dust concentration of less than 0.001
                            Fiber in 1 cm3, which is 1000 times less than the threshold threshold value. </p>

                        <p> It was in the States back in 1991, the court rejected the request of the Environmental Protection Agency
                            Of the US Environment (AZOS) on the prohibition of the use of asbestos in the US, since the evidence base was
                            Insolvent. </p>

                        <p> Asbestos-containing materials are not able to release into the atmosphere any significant
                            The number of fibers, and therefore, to use this material in construction can, especially not
                            It is worth talking about some harm, if it is a question of pipes that are completely hidden under
                            Other materials. </p>

                        <p> <strong> Types of slate roofs </strong> </p>

                        <p> The most common variants of slate roofs have been and remain wavy sheets to
                            To add to them the attractiveness, manufacturers began to paint this material in different
                            colors. However, high results have not yet been achieved in this area. Organic paints
                            Are less durable than the material itself, which can serve 30-40 years. AT
                            Currently, work is under way to create inorganic paints that will serve
                            As much as the slate itself. </p>

                        <p> Asbestos cement wavy sheet - this is a roofing made of finely-reinforced
                            Cement stone, the fibers of which have high tensile strength, are perceived
                            Tensile stresses. Such material possesses not only high mechanical strength,
                            But also other valuable properties: fire resistance, low water permeability, durability,
                            Has a small mass, 2-3 times cheaper than a metal roof. </p>

                        <p> Asbestos-cement roofs from corrugated sheets of an ordinary profile are arranged on roofs with
                            A slope of more than 20% (the optimal slope of the roof is 20-45 °). </p>

                        <p> Before starting work, the sheets are sorted, carefully examined and parallel
                            Prepare the steel elements of the roof (cornices, gutters, etc.). </p>

                        <p> <strong> Than good asbestos-cement roofing </strong> </p>

                        <p> Slate has high water-repellent properties, which is a very important indicator
                            For roofing material. In addition, he stoically exerts the influence of high and low
                            Temperature, humidity, solar radiation and snow loads, with the weight
                            Material is low, which makes it possible to mount a lightweight and sparse
                            Crate. </p>

                        <p> Asbestos-cement has heat-insulating properties, under it moisture does not condense,
                            So there is no need for vapor barrier. It effectively extinguishes noise from atmospheric precipitation.
                            Asbestos-cement slate does not burn, and its cost can be safely attributed to the category
                            Pluses. </p>

                        <p> Uncomplicated this material and in the processing: it can be cut and drilled with ordinary carpentry
                            Tools. </p>

                        <p> <strong> Disadvantages of asbestos-cement roofing </strong> </p>

                        <p> At the end of its life, the asbestos-cement roof begins to degrade actively: it loses its
                            Waterproof qualities, swells, and the edges of the sheets are easily dyed and broken off
                            (Especially in the longitudinal direction in asbestos-cement wavy sheets), but similar phenomena
                            Are observed on the roofs, which are 50 years old. </p>

                        <p> What really is the scourge of every slate roof is moss and lichens,
                            Who willingly settle down from the north side of the house. Periodically, they need to be cleaned. </p>

                        <p> <strong> Bundle material </strong> </p>

                        <p> Boards and bars for the crate should be taken not less than the second grade, width - no more than 14 cm,
                            Well dried (raw wood during drying will loosen the nail joint). If
                            The use of sawn timber is wider than 14 cm, in the end they will shrivel, warp and
                            Will damage the roof. Also it is desirable to choose boards without knots, they can break at
                            Load. </p>

                        <p> The size of the bar of the crate must be a section of 50-50 or 60-60 mm. The lining is nailed to
                            Rafters with nails. Lay out and fix the bars of the battens from the eaves to the ridge in steps of 530
                            Mm. </p>

                        <p> Each slate sheet must be supported by only three bars: at the edges and in the middle. At such a
                            The longitudinal overlap of the slate sheets will be dense and they will be firmly
                            Bar. </p>
                        <p> The roof roof is designed so that it can be packed with an integer
                            Sheets in both longitudinal and transverse directions. If this is not possible, in the roof
                            Insert cut sheets that are laid in transverse rows next to the penultimate of the pediment
                            Overhang, and in the longitudinal - at the ridge. </p>

                        <p> Using cropped pieces is not very convenient and cost-effective, which is more correct
                            Increase (but not more than 50 cm) or in extreme cases reduce the overhangs on the gables. </p>

                        <p> All even bars with the correct approach should have a height of not 60 mm, but 63 mm (in the case
                            50х50 - the height is not 50 mm, but 53 mm). For uniformity they are usually made the same, then
                            There is 60x60 mm (or 50x50), but in this case even bars are raised with the aid of bed
                            Laths 3 mm thick, laid on rafters. All these conditions must be observed,
                            So that the overlap of the sheets is dense and the sheets are firmly laid on the crate. </p>

                        <p> <strong> We lay the slate sheet </strong> </p>

                        <p> In order for the sheets to lie flat, you must use a cord stretched along the ramp.
                            The horizontal lapping of the rows should be 140 mm at a slope of up to 30-58% and 120 mm at more
                            Steep incline, and it is desirable to take into account the direction of the prevailing winds in this
                            Terrain so that the open edges of the sheets are facing the leeward side. </p>

                        <p> Cover the roof with overlapping one sheet of another one wave (with a dense overlap)
                            Asbestos-cement sheets can be in two ways: with the displacement of sheets in each subsequent row
                            And with cutting off adjacent angles. </p>

                        <p> According to the first method, the slate sheets are laid unzipped - with the longitudinal edges of the sheets displaced
                            On one or several waves in relation to the same edges of the sheets of the previously stacked row. AT
                            In this case, to cover one roof slope, it is likely to have to be cut along only
                            One sheet of slate either on one wave, or the whole sheet in half (both parts of you
                            Will need the next ramp). </p>

                        <p> As a result, undesirable four-fold overlapping of sheets in places of common
                            Joints, and the sheets themselves fit without cracks. </p>

                        <p> According to the second method, only corners (one wave) are cut in sheets, then the line for joining sheets
                            On the slope along the longitudinal edges will be straight. </p>

                        <p> It is recommended to cover relatively narrow sloping sheets with relatively narrow slopes, but
                            Long in the transverse direction of the ramp. Wide in slope, but short in transverse
                            The slope direction is covered with sheets with cut corners. </p>

                        <p> When laying asbestos-cement sheets, the four corners should not converge in one place?
                            Will lead to a distortion of the sheets and their loose fit. Snow and wind load on
                            Sheets will cause their excessive deformation, contributing to the development of cracks. Under tight joints
                            Begins to blow the wind, bringing snow to the attic. In this case it is necessary to put under
                            Slate roofing paper, which, in turn, causes the need for a continuous crate, and you
                            Get a more expensive roof. </p>

                        <p> If there are still gaps of more than 7 mm between the slate sheets, they should be closed with
                            Using waterproofing mastic, which is applied to overlapping strips of wood
                            Spatula with a layer 5-6 mm thick, with a width of 30-40 mm in the transverse joints, and in longitudinal -
                            60-70 mm. </p>

                        <p> <strong> Ways to fasten the slate to the crate </strong> </p>

                        <p> The hole for fixing the slate is made at a distance of 80-100 mm from the bottom edge of the ridge
                            Waves with a hand drill (the diameter of the drill is 1-2 mm larger than the diameter of the nail). If you do not take into account these
                            Proportions, then during mechanical and temperature deformations the sheet will crack. Wherein
                            Use a template to prevent the drill from slipping. The position of the holes depends on the intervals
                            Between beams of the crate. The layout of the locations of future holes is carried out when the sheets are still
                            Are in the original packaging. </p>

                        <p> The sheet is fastened to the crate with a slate (or usual) nail or screws 100 mm long with washer
                            From metal and a lining from rubber, roofing felt, a roofing material which cover a paint composition
                            (Preferably a primer) on natural linseed oil or mastic; The nail is slaughtered until
                            Washers will not perform the rest of the paint (not finishing to the end about 2-3 mm). </p>

                        <p> Unlike other building materials, the slate does not have additional elements. Therefore, the
                            In such a roof are protected by roofing steel or simply by two edged boards knocked down between
                            Yourself at the right angle. </p>

                        <p> <strong> Repair of asbestos-cement roofs </strong> </p>
                        <p> If you are at the inspection of the roof found heavily damaged sheets of slate (there are chipped,
                            Cracks) prepare for the fact that they will have to be replaced. For this, in the longitudinal
                            Direction from both sides of the removed sheet reinforce the bridges behind the ridge brackets. Across
                            Bridges lay the board. To release the damaged sheet, remove nails or screws,
                            Which it is attached to the crate. When pulling nails, the claw's feet rest on the edge
                            Navigation bridge or board. The damaged sheet is removed from the row so that the adjacent sheet
                            Remained in place. A new sheet is laid by two roofer. One lifts the weakened side
                            And on top of the sheets, and another, laying a new asbestos-cement sheet on the overlapping edge
                            Next, moves it towards the ridge. When the bottom edge of the new sheet coincides
                            With the edge of this row, it is attached to the base. Soft washers in all attachments lubricate and
                            They are stained with a surreal paint. </p>

                        <p> Asbestos sheets themselves are subject to repair, however, the damage should not be significant.
                            Small cracks can be pasted with tar, underlay felt, mastic cloth, copying
                            The surface of the sheet. Pasted sheet manually. Apply a brush to the corrugations with mastic, then
                            Paste the fabric, pressing it firmly against the surface of the sheet. </p>

                        <p> When replacing up to 10 m2 of the cover from asbestos-cement sheets, first disassemble the overlying
                            Roofing, then remove the damaged sheets. New sheets are laid on the crate
                            From bottom to top, that is, from the eaves to the ridge with overlapping of the underlying row by 120 mm with
                            Slope of more than 58% and 140 mm with a smaller slope. The sheets are fastened to the crate by one nail or
                            Screw, necessarily putting under his head a soft washer. Sheets of cornice support
                            Additionally with two screws. </p>

                        <p> <strong> Painting of asbestos-cement roofing </strong> </p>

                        <p> Painted slate roofs look quite respectable, and paint is optional
                            Protection for the material, prolonging his life, including not allowing lichens and mosses
                            Settle on this roofing. Paint reduces water absorption, increases
                            Frost resistance of roofing materials and prolongs their service life. </p>

                        <p> For asbestos-cement roofing, weatherproof, moisture-resistant and frost-resistant
                            Oil and acryl paints and enamels. </p>

                        <p> A new slate before painting is recommended to withstand
                            Atmospheric conditions for 3-4 months. </p>

                        <p> When painting old roofs, the vegetation on them should be removed mechanically from
                            Using metal brushes or scrapers, then the surface should be etched with antiseptic
                            And rinse with water. </p>

                        <p> Before proceeding with painting, the slate is primed and allowed to dry. This will fix
                            Surface and will prevent further color separation. </p>

                        <p> Asbestos-cement roofing is painted with a fly brush or a hand, collecting a small amount
                            Paint and shading it along the slope. The duration of each layer
                            Temperature of air 10-15 ° С not less than 24-36 hours. </p>

                        <p> With sheets covered with paint, handle carefully, so as not to damage the finishing layer. AT
                            The first years of operation at home a layer of paint after attaching the roof is usually slightly erased.
                            This is especially noticeable when snow falls from the roof, it can have a shade of roofing
                            Material, but that's okay. </p>

                        <p> Asbestos-cement sheets should in no case be punched with nails. So you get instead
                            Neat hole network of cracks, which with time will turn into the launching pad for
                            More serious defects. Given that in Belarus several times a year is announced
                            Storm warning, slate must be fastened only with screws and staples in the cornice
                            Row. </p>
