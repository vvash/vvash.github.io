                        <blockquote> <p> Today flat roof is undeservedly used in private construction much
                            Less often than pitched. Many are guided in this question by the stereotypes inherent in us yet
                            From childhood: the older generation remembers well how the upper floors flowed
                            From roofing felt, and how hot it was to live on these floors in the summer. But times change, and
                            Today in construction there are many quality remarkable materials that can be
                            Use when building such a roof. Yes, and technology, too, has since moved far
                            Forward. </p> </blockquote>



                        <p> In addition to the ease of installation, during which workers have a much lower chance of admission
                            Errors, flat roofs - this is a modern, reliable, simple, inexpensive and aesthetic solution.
                            They look very modern. Most importantly, in the case of a pitched roof arrangement in a two-
                            Or a single-story house many make a cold loft But if you think about it, then the second
                            On the floor, we build up the props, in fact it does not have any function, only
                            Visual. And then often you want to "grab" such an attic so that it does not empty - and after all
                            It's already a full-fledged investment of money! Many people believe that there should not be snow on
                            Roof and therefore make a slope of more than 35 degrees, because if less, it is likely to snow
                            To lie down. But remember at home in the Alps? Remember that the angle is about 15 degrees, and why?
                            I will assume that there people know the secret - snow can not only weigh a lot, but still, no matter how
                            Strange, and can reduce the thermal conductivity of the roof. I smoothly brought you to the question: is it worth
                            Rake the roof of the snow? And in order not to worry about leakage, pay attention to
                            PVC-membrane, this is a new material in our market, but in the world it exists for a long time. Instead
                            Two layers only one is needed, the membrane is fixed only in the joints. Resistant to UV rays,
                            Vapor-permeable. By the way, I planned a similar roofing for my house. </p>

                        <p> As an overlap, you can put reinforced concrete slabs, wooden beams and ... metal profiles, yes, yes,
                            Ordinary metal profiled sheet as, for example, in hypermarkets. It turns out that he
                            Quite inexpensive and reliable, a span of 4-5 meters can be covered without retaining beams. I
                            Would also add that the ceiling of the beams for the arrangement of a flat roof will be more expensive, and
                            A lot of questions on the deflection of beams, bugs, fire resistance, etc. </p>

                        <h2> Types of flat roof </h2>

                        <h3> Operated </h3>

                        <p> Already from its name it is clear that on it will be heavy objects, people
                            etc. Operated flat roof is used to arrange on the roof terrace, winter
                            Gardens, greenhouses, etc. </p>

                        <p> The peculiarity of such a roof is that under the waterproofing a rigid foundation is laid or
                            A screed so that the roof can withstand loads, while maintaining integrity and not
                            Pushed. </p>

                        <h3> "Green" </h3>

                        <p> It is a kind of exploited roof and can be created on the basis of traditional
                            Or the inversion structure of the "pie". The peculiarity of such a roof is the cultivation of plants on it
                            And the creation of special layers that allow these plants to normally exist and
                            Develop without harming the hydro- and thermal insulation. </p>

                        <h3> Inversion </h3>

                        <p> This is an alternative constructive solution to the traditional flat roof. The difference is,
                            That the layer of insulation is not located under the waterproofing carpet, but above it. This
                            The design allows to protect a waterproof carpet from destructive influence
                            UV rays, sudden temperature changes, freeze-thaw cycles, and
                            Mechanical damage. All this increases the service life of such a roof in comparison with
                            Traditional soft roof. </p>

                        <p> The slope of the inversion roof is recommended to be arranged at an angle of 2.5-5%. If the surface
                            It is covered with a layer of gravel, melt and rainwater through the gravel layer flows down through
                            Filter material and flows down the carpet of waterproofing to specially equipped
                            Drainage devices. </p>

                        <h3> <strong> Traditional </strong> </h3>

                        <p> Represents a "pie" consisting of a bearing plate with a vapor barrier applied to it, on
                            Which is laid insulation. On the insulation is made a mortar with a razuglonkoj, and on
                            This screed is applied waterproofing protective carpet from roll materials. </p>

                        <h2> What is the "sick" flat roof? </h2>

                        <p> If you decide to build a house with a flat roof or already live in a house with such a roof, you
                            It is necessary to remember about possible basic defects that occur during its operation. </p>

                        <p> The accumulation of moisture in local areas leads to the fact that when heated under waterproofing
                            Carpets are created high-pressure pockets. They tear the roof in problem areas. For
                            Bitumen roofs are the places of the joints of the canvas and the adjacency. One way to deal with this
                            Defect is the use of materials that can distribute internal vapor pressure
                            Water under the waterproofing carpet and relieve the excess pressure. </p>

                        <p> The causes of defects can be different: the absence of shrinkage joints at the base
                            Roofing; Large gaps between the plates and the sagging of the roofing carpet; The presence of moisture between
                            The top layer of the roofing cloth and the lower one; Moisture and dust in the base of the roof, etc. </p>

                        <p> If the roof is cracked, swollen or leaking, it is worth checking the condition
                            Thermal insulation - it happens that it gets wet and needs replacing. Classical technology for
                            The elimination of these defects is the complete disassembly of the roofing carpet, drying or replacement
                            Insulation, repair of vapor barrier layer. If the replacement of the thermal insulation layer is not possible
                            (Insufficient funds, do not allow it to make weather conditions, etc.), then, in
                            In the extreme case, through it, with a certain step, flywalls, places of interface with
                            The roof is sealed, and with time, the natural drying of the roof occurs. </p>

                        <p> To avoid such defects and the cost of future repairs, experts today recommend
                            Choose the installation of roofing covering the technology of "breathing roof." </p>

                        <p> The term "breathable" roof means that a roofing carpet can pass in one direction a pair
                            Water, removing them into the atmosphere from the thermal insulation layer. </p>

                        <p> For bitumen roofs this is achieved by using a special lower layer that has
                            A branched network of air channels connected to each other. Thanks to these channels, pairs
                            Water can be distributed over the entire surface of the roof, and to divert excess
                            Pressure apply special aerial aerators - flywagks. </p>

                        <p> Fluxplugs are also used in a membrane roof in the case if it consists of an elastomer, or
                            When it is necessary to intensify the output of vapors when repairing old roofs. </p>

                        <p> The process of ventilation allows you to extend the life of bitumen roofs at times. The main reason
                            Aging "breathing" roofs in this case will be the impact of ultraviolet. </p>

                        <p> If we are talking about bituminous materials, then although they are the most traditional, affordable and cheap,
                            While they are also short-lived and not technologically advanced. Their quality can not be considered
                            Sufficient for modern construction. Over time, the cost of roof repairs with
                            Such a coating may exceed the cost of their original device. </p>

                        <p> But the use of synthetic membrane materials at the present stage acquires all
                            Great popularity because of their longer service life. They are resistant to
                            UV-radiation, aggressive environments, mechanical and climatic loads, fireproof,
                            Resistant to aging. </p>

                        <p> The most common defects that arise when installing flat roofs are associated with the level
                            Training roofer. This includes neprovar stitches, ignorance of standard knots,
                            Violation of technology. As a rule, the weakest places are the seams themselves, the junctions of the
                            Walls, parapets, pipes, stands, night tables, funnels. Such defects appear in the first
                            Same half a year of operation. </p>
                        <p> Regarding the repair of flat roofs, it is difficult to find and get to the place of leakage, if
                            The roof is filled with something. On the roofs to be exploited, the top layers must be removed to
                            Get to the waterproofing. In polymeric roofs, there is rarely a fully glued
                            System, so that sometimes there is a difficulty with the localization of the leakage source. </p>

                        <h2> Insulation features </h2>

                        <p> The base of the flat roof is a load-bearing slab, reinforced concrete, monolithic or from a profiled sheet.
                            On top of it is a vapor barrier material, then a layer of thermal insulation. </p>

                        <p> There is a one- and two-layer system of thermal insulation of a flat roof, the latter is used more often:
                            The lower layer thickness of 70-200 mm takes on the basic thermal insulation function, the top layer
                            Thickness of 30-50 mm is responsible mainly for the redistribution of mechanical stress and
                            It is characterized by high compressive strength and density. This "specialization" of the layers
                            "Pie" flat roof can significantly reduce its weight and, accordingly, the load on the
                            Overlapping. </p>

                        <h2> Ventilation device </h2>

                        <p> Water vapor, which is constantly formed in the premises of the house, due to diffusion and convective
                            The process rises upward and, by cooling, condenses in the under-roof space,
                            Especially in the winter. Overabundant condensation leads to wet spots and mold
                            On walls and ceiling, and excess moisture, accumulating in heat-insulating material, reduces it
                            Properties. </p>

                        <p> Roof fans (aerators), special pipes of different types
                            Diameters of metal or plastic, covered from above with caps in the shape of umbrellas. </p>

                        <p> The principle of the aerator is based on the difference in pressures caused by air currents. Him
                            The design allows moisture vapor to freely flow out from under the roofing carpet, without damaging
                            The latter and preventing the formation of bubbles and flaking of the roofing material. </p>

                        <p> On flat roofs of a simple configuration, aerators are placed evenly over the entire area in
                            The highest points of the roof plane in the places of joints of heat-insulating plates. Their
                            Install better when installing the roof itself. </p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <blockquote> <p> There are houses consisting of only one roof, the so-called pyramids, o
                            Which we wrote in the previous issue, geodesic domes, house-huts and the like. A

                            The overwhelming part of all projects of country houses assumes use of old kind
                            Technology pitched roof in the form of the letter "A". But is it really necessary? <br/> In Germany and
                            Switzerland has long been in fashion projects of individual buildings with a flat roof. Projects
                            Even use as a coating of the same metal, placed under the
                            A small angle of 5-7%. The insulation is very simple. </p> </blockquote>


                        <p> In addition to the originality of the architectural design, this roof device "pulls"
                            Some cheaper construction. After all, if you are not interested in having an attic or
                            Attic with beveled walls, you want all the ceilings to be ordinary rectangular,
                            Then why do you need a roof in principle? And saving money, time, refusal from expensive
                            Specialists can be very "useful." <br/> In addition to cheaper and time-saving
                            Construction there are pluses and in the part of the subsequent operation: compare the area
                            Heat transfer at the pitched and flat roof. With a flat roof of 100 m2 sloping, covering
                            The same building will have an area of ​​115 m2 (angle of inclination 30 °) or 140 m2, if you want
                            Make the attic floor (angle of inclination 45 °). In this case, the slope of the sloping roof allows the sun
                            In the summer warm it almost at an angle of 90 ° from 9.00 to 19.00, which does not improve the situation inside the house
                            Or near such a roof. All this speaks in favor of a flat roof, which in winter
                            It warms up more quickly, and even in the summer it gives less hassle. The self-packing of a flat roof
                            More convenient than pitched: it's easier to mount a roofing "pie" under your feet than on a large
                            Height in an unsafe position. Flat roof maintenance, preventive inspections,
                            Cleaning funnels, etc. Also not very difficult, and the control of technical
                            Devices, working with chimneys, antennas, ventilation ducts and flooring in this
                            Case - not an extravagant climbing class, but the usual procedure. <br/> The most
                            A tempting condition here lies in the fact that if you want on such a roof you can arrange
                            Exploited area, sow it with a lawn, a pool with umbrellas to put and sunbathe yourself.
                            This topic is especially relevant if the site is small. Flat roofs, or roofs, having
                            Small slope (2-5%), suitable for residential buildings, and for their protruding parts:
                            Garages, terraces and outbuildings. <br/> Among the shortcomings, two
                            Moment, capable of covering all the advantages of such a structure: if materials,
                            Used for the roof, will not allow its structural elements and details for a long time
                            Function, perestilat such a roof will have every 2-3 years; With heavy snowfalls on
                            Flat roofs accumulate a significant amount of snow, which, melting, can become
                            Cause of leaks. <br /> But, fortunately, every year there are new materials for
                            Devices of flat roofs, able to solve this and other problems. The ruberoid is gone,
                            A short period of operation of which required too frequent repairs. In place of expanded clay
                            Came more effective insulation, as interlayers and drainage layers began to apply
                            Geosynthetics (2 cm of compressive geosynthetic drainage material now replaced
                            30 cm of crushed stone). There are a lot of innovations, thus, it becomes important only
                            Their correct application in compliance with the technology, which we will talk about. </p>

                        <p> <strong> Requirements for flat roofs </strong> </p>

                        <p> The reliability and durability of flat roofs guarantees the use of modern construction
                            Technologies and materials. In this case, water resistance, incombustibility, ease of installation and
                            Services will not become unattainable targets for builders, and the service life of the structure and
                            The reliability of its elements will not be hostage to the adverse effects of the
                            Wednesday. <br/> The first requirement: a flat roof of a residential building must be insulated. If this is not
                            Make, when contacting warm air from rooms with a cold surface of the coating
                            A condensate forms, which appears on the ceiling with wet spots, and accumulates in the
                            The moisture will gradually destroy the roof. <br/> The second requirement: increased attention to
                            Waterproofing. The fact is that elements of overlapping, thermal insulation and sealing
                            Materials have different coefficients of temperature expansion. Resins included in the composition
                            Many waterproofing materials, almost 10 times more compressed than wood, steel
                            Or concrete, when exposed to low temperatures (in winter). At the same time, they are also elastic
                            They lose. Thus, it turns out: frosts hit - bitumens shrink strongly, and carriers
                            Constructions - less. Here are the load-bearing elements of the structure and pull the bitumen, tear them, as a result
                            Which causes cracks in the coating. In the summer, of course, the sun will warm them up and everything will be melted, but
                            Next winter - again the same story. The situation is deteriorating, and in 2-3 years is already required
                            Capital repairs, so all the benefits from such a roof evaporate. <br/> <strong> Types
                                Flat roofing </ strong> <br/> Where does the roof begin? Just like in the song - "from the picture in
                            Your letter ", that is, from the project. This is the simplest and most reliable way - to entrust all
                            Calculations to professionals. The second option - more difficult - to get to everything with your mind, including
                            And with the help of our magazine. <br/> You can make a flat roof on wooden floors,
                            For example, frame houses, but in this article the details of wooden structures are not
                            Let's move on to the next works. <br/> So, we have a reason, crowning
                            The last floor of the house (cottage, villa, garage, booth). After the installation of reinforced concrete slabs
                            The coating can not be called even; therefore, before proceeding to the installation of a roofing
                            "Pie", it is necessary to conduct some preparatory measures. <br/>
                            Perimeter of the roof it is necessary to arrange a parapet. This is required by fire regulations, as well as
                            Common sense: walking on an unprotected roof is just dangerous, especially since there can be
                            Be and your children. In addition, since the overhangs of the roof will be absent, as well as
                            The roof itself, then without the device of the parapet and the organized catchment the moisture will flow down
                            The wall, destroying the coating and adding unnecessary dampness to anyone. Regardless of the height of the building
                            It is necessary to provide fences for the operated flat roofs,
                            Balconies, loggias, outdoor galleries, outdoor outdoor staircases, stair flights and playgrounds.
                            This can be a continuation of the wall, raised to a height of 750-900 mm (not less than 500 mm). In order to
                            To exclude the possibility of freezing of concrete overlapping, all surfaces of the parapet follow
                            To insulate. <br/> In advance, we stipulate the presence of gutters. They may be
                            Internal or external. More details about them will be discussed below, but at this stage
                            It is necessary to solve the fundamental question: where will the funnels be located. <br/> Flat roofs
                            Are divided into exploited and unexploited. <br/> The peculiarity of the exploited roof is,
                            That its foundation must be rigid. What for? And because the very purpose of such a roof
                            Originally laid as a place for all kinds of "meeting evenings," in groups and in
                            Single citizens will move around, using the roof as a viewing platform, a place
                            For games, recreation, entertainment, eating shish kebab and other fun. In such cases
                            Waterproofing, whatever it is, should be protected capitally - this is shown
                            In Fig. 1. Pay attention: in such a roof the heater is laid over the waterproofing.
                            This is the solution for the actively operated flat roof. Otherwise, you will not be able to save
                            The integrity of the moisture barrier. The basis is a concrete screed that creates
                            The necessary slope for drainage, or corrugated board. Heater on such a roof will be
                            To experience increased static and dynamic loads, and therefore must have a high
                            compressive strength. If there is insufficient stiffness of the heater on top of it,
                            Cement screed. <br/> If on a flat roof shish kebabs, sports games and other excesses
                            Are not supposed, but it is possible the appearance on the roof of antennas, fans, and
                            Specified categories of citizens will move around the roof in rare and small groups, no
                            The need to make the roof in operation and arrange over the waterproofing and insulation
                            Screed, lay out the tile. The issue of protection can be solved much easier: for example, the layer
                            Sand or pebbles (expanded clay, gravel). <br/> If the flat roof is not operated, i.e. On her
                            If there is someone to go out, it is rare (once a month, but on business and so that you do not leave
                            Mechanical damage to the coating), the layer of waterproofing is enough to cover
                            Reflective material (paint, mastic). Typical unexploited roof - in Fig. 2.
                            Please note: here is already a classic "pie" for flat roofing - waterproofing over
                            Thermal insulation. In these cases for the maintenance of the roof, bridges or ladders are built, which
                            Help distribute loads on its surface. Such roofs are cheaper, but their term
                            Operation is less than that of the exploited. </p>

                            <p> <strong> Disclaimer </strong> </p>

                            <p> One of the main reasons for reducing the service life of the roofing is due to the formation
                            Stagnant zones on its surface. In such places after precipitation are formed first
                            Puddles, then life begins in them: the seeds of plants are brought in by the wind, moss begins to grow,
                            Grass and even trees (in especially neglected cases). Roots gradually damage
                            Waterproofing coating and, therefore, lead to premature failure of the whole
                            Roofing structure. Multiple and periodic processes of freezing-thawing of water in
                            Stagnant zones lead to premature failure of waterproofing
                            <br/> This problem is related to the violation or incorrect device of slopes and
                            Countercloons on the roof. The "flat" roof is only in theory, in life it is still
                            Sloping, only the angle of the slope (slope) in it is minimal - 1.5-4% (2% slope means a rise of 2
                            Cm for each meter of length). It is best if the slope is given by a bearing foundation, but
                            It is also possible to use traditional methods for the device of the rounder, to
                            Example claydite or insulating slabs with a slope. <br/> On flat roofs with
                            The main bias of more than 1.5% significantly reduces the risk of possible leaks: decreases
                            The number of stagnant zones, the load on the base decreases, and the stability
                            Structures to damage by microorganisms, punctures of waterproofing plant roots.
                            The appearance of a small defect in the roof covering on the surface with the required gradient is not
                            Will lead to serious consequences, while on flat roofs with a slope of less than 1.5%
                            Water penetrates into the cracks, exacerbating existing problems. <br/> One option
                            Is the device of the main slope of the roof, given by the most load-bearing structure, for example
                            Slabs of overlapping. This gradient is set in the process of laying. However, not always exists
                            Such a constructive possibility, in addition, the device of bias thus does not solve
                            Questions on contrklon from parapets, which still have to be created by others
                            Means. Also not very pleasant is the presence of ceilings under this roof, having such
                            The same bias, although this issue can be solved with the help of drywall. <br/> В качестве традиционных
                            Solutions for creating slopes and counter-slopes are applied low-cost backfill heaters
                            (Expanded clay, perlite) or light concrete mixtures (expanded polystyrene concrete, expanded clay concrete,
                            Perlite concrete). Use zasypnogo insulation - the most common option for
                            The reason for the simple implementation of this process, the availability of materials and their relative
                            Cheapness, and also a small mass (the specific weight of claydite is about 400 kg / m3).
                            The technology is really simple: guide beacons are installed at the required angle in
                            The side of the drainage funnel, and according to their level, the claydite is filled with tamping
                            Or pouring lightweight concrete. On top of the layer of expanded clay sifted with cement milk,
                            So that when filling the screed, there is no displacement of this loose material. Moving when
                            This is better for the sprinkled layer, having spread wide boards or shields. <br/> Also for the device
                            Slope on the roof used a variety of plate heaters, which with the help of cutting
                            Tools (for example, hacksaws, saws, cutters) are modified for further use in
                            As an inclined layer. The execution of these works is associated with large time and
                            Labor costs of the file, calculation of geometry, etc. <br/> To get the desired bias,
                            It is possible to use special slabs of thermal insulation with a slope made in production.

                        <p> <strong> What are the advantages of a flat roof? </strong> </p>

                        <p> There are houses consisting of only one roof - the so-called pyramids, of which we

                        <p> The vast majority of all projects of country houses involves the use of good old
                            Technology pitched roof in the form of the letter "A". But is it really necessary? <br/> In Germany and
                            Switzerland has long been in fashion projects of individual buildings with a flat roof. Projects

                            In 100 m2 pitched, covering the same building, will have an area of ​​115 m2 (angle of inclination 30 °)
                            Or 140 m2, if you want to make an attic floor (angle of inclination 45 °). In this case, the slope
                            The pitched roof allows the sun to warm it in summer at an angle of 90 ° from 9.00 to 19.00, which is not
                            Improves the situation inside the house or near such a roof. All this speaks in favor of
                            Flat roofing, which warms up more quickly in winter, and in summer it produces less

                            Whatever it is, it should be protected capitally - this is shown in Fig. 1. Please
                            Attention: in such a roof, the insulation is laid over the waterproofing. This is the solution
                            For an actively operated flat roof. Otherwise, it will not be possible to preserve the integrity
                            Moisture-proof layer. The basis can be a concrete screed, creating the necessary bias
                            For tap water, or corrugated board. Heater on such a roof will experience elevated
                            Static and dynamic loads, and therefore must have a high compressive strength. When
                            Insufficient hardness of the insulation on top of it should be made of cement screed. <br/> If
                            On a flat roof shish kebabs, sports games and other excesses are not supposed, but
                            Perhaps the appearance on the roof of antennas, fans, and these categories of citizens
                            Will move along the roof of rare and small groups, there is no need to do
                            Exploited roofing and arrange for waterproofing and insulation screed, lay out
                            Tiles. The issue of protection can be solved much easier: for example, a layer of sand or pebbles
                            (Expanded clay, gravel). <br/> If the flat roof is not operated, i.e. On her if anyone will be
                            To go out, it is rare (once a month, but on business and so that not to leave mechanical
                            Damage to the coating), it is sufficient to cover the waterproofing layer with reflective
                            Material (paint, mastic). Typical unexploited roof - in Fig. 2. Please
                            Attention: here is already a classic "pie" for flat roofing - waterproofing over
                            Thermal insulation. In these cases for the maintenance of the roof, bridges or ladders are built, which
                            Help distribute loads on its surface. Such roofs are cheaper, but their term
                            Operation is less than that of the exploited. </p>

                        <p> <strong> Disclaimer </strong> </p>
                        <p> One of the main reasons for reducing the service life of the roofing is due to the formation
                            Stagnant zones on its surface. In such places after precipitation are formed first
                            Puddles, then life begins in them: the seeds of plants are brought in by the wind, moss begins to grow,
                            Grass and even trees (in especially neglected cases). Roots gradually damage
                            Waterproofing coating and, therefore, lead to premature failure of the whole
                            Roofing structure. Multiple and periodic processes of freezing-thawing of water in
                            Stagnant zones lead to premature failure of waterproofing
                            <br/> This problem is related to the violation or incorrect device of slopes and
                            Countercloons on the roof. The "flat" roof is only in theory, in life it is still
                            Sloping, only the angle of the slope (slope) in it is minimal - 1.5-4% (2% slope means a rise of 2
                            Cm for each meter of length). It is best if the slope is given by a bearing foundation, but
                            It is also possible to use traditional methods for the device of the rounder, to
                            Example claydite or insulating slabs with a slope. <br/> On flat roofs with
                            The main bias of more than 1.5% significantly reduces the risk of possible leaks: decreases
                            The number of stagnant zones, the load on the base decreases, and the stability
                            Structures to damage by microorganisms, punctures of waterproofing plant roots.
                            The appearance of a small defect in the roof covering on the surface with the required gradient is not
                            Will lead to serious consequences, while on flat roofs with a slope of less than 1.5%
                            Water penetrates into the cracks, exacerbating existing problems. <br/> One option
                            Is the device of the main slope of the roof, given by the most load-bearing structure, for example
                            Slabs of overlapping. This gradient is set in the process of laying. However, not always exists
                            Such a constructive possibility, in addition, the device of bias thus does not solve
                            Questions on contrklon from parapets, which still have to be created by others
                            Means. Also not very pleasant is the presence of ceilings under this roof, having such
                            The same bias, although this issue can be solved with the help of drywall. <br/> As traditional
                            Solutions for creating slopes and counter-slopes are applied low-cost backfill heaters
                            (Expanded clay, perlite) or light concrete mixtures (expanded polystyrene concrete, expanded clay concrete,
                            Perlite concrete). Use zasypnogo insulation - the most common option for
                            The reason for the simple implementation of this process, the availability of materials and their relative
                            Cheapness, and also a small mass (the specific weight of claydite is about 400 kg / m3).
                            The technology is really simple: guide beacons are installed at the required angle in
                            The side of the drainage funnel, and according to their level, the claydite is filled with tamping
                            Or pouring lightweight concrete. On top of the layer of expanded clay sifted with cement milk,
                            So that when filling the screed, there is no displacement of this loose material. Moving when
                            This is better for the sprinkled layer, spreading wide boards or shields. </p>


                        <p> <strong> Steam insulation </strong> </p>

                        <p> Before carrying out measures for the vapor barrier it is necessary to wait until the coupler and the stranger
                            Completely dry, otherwise the increased humidity and related problems you get in
                            The very beginning of the roofing. <br/> It is necessary to install all engineering equipment,
                            Requiring mechanical fastening. For example, to fix to the bearing plates rainwater funnels,
                            Compensators for expansion joints, branch pipes for the passage of engineering equipment, anchor
                            Bolts. <br/> If on the surface of the screed after the rain there are puddles - this is the first signal that,
                            That the measures taken to arrange the deviations were not carried out correctly, the roof should already be
                            work. In any case, excess water should be removed (manually with rags or a vacuum cleaner - this is
                            Someone as it will), and dry the roof. <br/> Steam insulation is a reinforced
                            Fiberglass bitumen-polymer membrane or vapor barrier film, which is laid
                            Over the screed, and at the edge of the roof, wind up on a vertical plane to a height greater than
                            Height of insulation. The seams are glued with special tape or sealed. Main Function
                            Vapor barrier - protection of the insulation against water vapor coming from inside the house, prevention
                            Its wetting, bloating and guaranteeing the preservation of all the original properties. This happens
                            Because in buildings with a flat roof, as a rule, under the reinforced concrete slab there are always warm
                            Premises. That is, under the roof is always a "+", and over the roof a few months in a year
                            The temperature is always lower, and with the sign "-". <br/> It goes without saying that if
                            The dissonance is carried out with the help of insulation plates, then the vapor barrier is stacked up to them. </p>

                        <p> <strong> Insulation </strong> </p>

                        <p> Insulate flat roofs with almost any insulation. There are types of heaters
                            For flat roofs and for producers of mineral wool, foam and, of course,
                            Extruded polystyrene foam. Which one is more suitable - difficult to say, often
                            The best is the one that is more correctly laid. <br/> But, for example, for warming
                            Only non-hygroscopic materials capable of preserving
                            High thermal insulation characteristics in a moist environment - extruded foams with
                            Closed pores, close to zero water absorption, good heat-shielding
                            Characteristics in a humid environment and sufficient strength. <br/> The thickness of the layer of insulation
                            Depends on the type of flat roof you choose, the thickness of the substrate and the material from which
                            It is executed. In any case, it is necessary to calculate the thermal conductivity of materials,
                            Entering into your roofing "pie", on the basis of which the thickness of the selected
                            Insulation. How to calculate the thermal conductivity, you can find out in the article "How much is it
                            Warming, if you want to save money? "</p>

                        <p> <strong> Waterproofing </strong> </p>

                        <p> Currently, the market for roofing waterproofing materials are: <br/> -
                            Rolled materials based on polyester, fiberglass or bitumen, modified
                            Polymers; <br/> - polymeric membranes; <br/> - bitumen and asphalt mastics; <br/> -
                            Materials based on liquid rubber. </p>

                        <p> & nbsp; </p>

                        <p> <strong> Rolled Materials </strong> </p>

                        <p> The main part of the roofing materials market for flat roofs is occupied by roll products. it
                            Far from that ruberoid of the period of industrial housing construction, and modern
                            High-tech materials from modified bitumen. <br/> Modified by polymers
                            Bitumen roofing materials are characterized by increased resistance to atmospheric
                            Effects, and consequently, a longer one - 20-25 years and even more - a service life.
                            Most often, styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) and atactic
                            Polypropylene plastic (APP). These modifiers have specific properties. APP
                            Gives the roof a resistance to ultraviolet radiation, and SBS - plasticity, which
                            It is especially important for large temperature differences. Obviously, for climatic conditions
                            Most European countries, including Belarus, are more suitable
                            SBS-modified roofing materials. </p>

                        <p> <strong> Polymer membranes </strong> </p>

                        <p> In addition to bitumen-polymer roll materials, polymer rolls
                            Materials, for which the term "roofing membranes" is firmly entrenched. It is worth noting that
                            Some other roofing materials are often called membranes. It's connected with
                            Borrowing the term from Western technical literature, where all roofing rolls
                            Materials are called membranes. <br /> Polymer materials form two main groups,
                            Differing in technical and operational characteristics: elastomers and thermoplastics.
                            The elastomers used in the manufacture of roofing materials include manufactured
                            From EPDM (synthetic rubber - ethylene-propylene-diene-monomer), and to thermoplastics - from
                            PVC. <br/> Polymer membranes are characterized by higher strength and durability than
                            Bitumen-polymeric materials, elasticity, good resistance to atmospheric phenomena,
                            Oxidation and exposure to ultraviolet rays, as well as frost resistance. However, polymeric
                            Membranes, as a rule, are 20-30% more expensive than bitumen-polymer materials. <br/> Distinctive
                            The feature of polymeric materials is the large width of the membranes. Thanks to this, you can
                            Choose the best option for buildings of all sizes and configurations and thereby reduce
                            Number of joints and seams. </p>

                        <p> The most common are three main types of polymer roofing membranes. <br/> -
                            EPDM membranes. The seams of membranes can be assembled using a special two-sided
                            Self-adhesive tape without heating. The EPDM membrane has a high elasticity, low
                            Weight, resistance to sudden changes in temperature. Also produced are reinforced
                            EPDM membranes. They are more durable, but less elastic. The main advantage of roofing
                            Waterproofing systems is that when repairing the roof EPDM membranes can be stacked
                            Over the old ruberoid carpet, which reduces the complexity of the preparatory work.
                            Imported EDPM membranes are quite expensive. <br/> - Membranes based on thermoplastic
                            Polyolefins (TPO). Stitches in such material are fastened with special welding machines with
                            Using hot air. Due to the reinforcing layer (polyester mesh) the material is more
                            Resistant to mechanical stress, but less elastic than EPDM membranes. TPO membrane
                            It is advisable to use it on new constructions, on roofs of complex configuration and where
                            There is a high risk of accidental damage to the membrane (residential buildings, roofs, over which there are
                            Floors), as well as in cases where the roof will be subjected to increased mechanical
                            Loads during operation and construction. <br/> - PVC-membranes. Sealing of seams
                            Is produced by welding with hot air. They have high strength (reinforced with polyester
                            Grid) and a variety of colors (9 standard colors, there is a possibility
                            Devices of a transparent membrane). Well tolerate roughness and deformation of the substrate. Wide
                            The choice of membranes with different characteristics allows them to be used in different conditions.
                            PVC membranes are often used in Western countries, they have not yet received
                            Due distribution, as their installation requires special equipment. </p>

                        <p> <strong> Seamless roofing materials </strong> </p>
                        <p> Despite the fact that the estimated lifetime of modern roll materials is significantly
                            Increased, they still did not lose the main drawbacks - leaks in the joints and
                            The need for regular repairs. For the duration of their service, both constructive solutions
                            And applied technologies and equipment for gluing roll materials. To avoid
                            Leakage at the junctions, seamless materials such as mastics and liquid
                            Rubber. <br/> Modern mastics can be used as a roofing material or
                            Adhesive compound for the construction of a roofing carpet from roll materials for both erection
                            New roofs, and for repairing old ones. Mastic is a liquid-viscous homogeneous
                            Mass, which after deposition on the surface and hardening turns into a monolithic
                            coating. The composition of the mastic is divided into bitumen, bitumen-polymer and polymer. <br/>
                            The composition of the mastic can include a solvent, fillers and various additives, including
                            Giving the material the desired color. Bitumen, bitumen-polymer and polymeric mastics
                            Differ from similar roll materials in that they form in the waterproofing layer
                            Directly on the roof surface. Otherwise they have the same properties.
                            Some types of mastic (the so-called cold mastic) in the process of construction
                            Works do not require preheating. To improve the strength characteristics
                            Mastic roofs, they can be reinforced with glass wool or fiberglass. Reinforcement increases
                            Strength, but reduces the elasticity of the mastic layer. Therefore, it can be performed only in
                            Separate nodes (usually in junctions and conjugations). <br/> The advantages of mastic roofs
                            It is possible to carry absence of places of joints and seams in a roofing carpet. Lack of mastic layer
                            Is that it is difficult to achieve a guaranteed thickness of the insulating film, especially when
                            Large inclines and uneven surfaces. Therefore, you must either carefully prepare
                            Surface, or increase the consumption of material. Both of which lead to an increase in the cost
                            Coating. <br/> But to date, developed mastics that allow you to control
                            Quality and thickness of the layer, as well as to minimize the consumption of material due to the application
                            The original method - applying mastic in two layers. First, the first layer of one
                            Color, and then the second - a contrasting color. The thickness of the applied second layer should be
                            Be so that the first layer does not shine through. <br/> The liquid rubber that represents
                            An emulsion based on oil derivatives with the addition of elastomers of natural rubber,
                            Can be used to ensure the waterproofness of the roof of any structure. As a result,
                            Applying liquid rubber to the surface of the roof (by spraying with a special
                            Equipment) a single seamless polymerized membrane is formed, which is
                            Absolutely water-, steam- and gas-tight. <br/> To lacks of liquid rubber it is possible to carry
                            That for the normal course of the process of vulcanization of work it is necessary to produce only
                            At a temperature of +10 ° С and relative humidity of air no more than 50%. Do not apply
                            Coating for materials whose moisture index exceeds 30%. The basis must be
                            Dry, clean and smooth. <br/> At a covering from liquid rubber two enemies - the sun and external
                            Mechanical effects. Guaranteed service life of UV-free membrane
                            Of liquid rubber thickness of 3 mm - 7 years, with luck - 10 years. Would you like to increase this period
                            For an unexploited roof? Then the liquid rubber should be protected from ultraviolet radiation.
                            The simplest with a reasonable way is to paint with light paint (without solvents) or
                            To spray a layer of acrylic-polymeric mastic - in general, any paint or mastic of light
                            Tones, which will lie on the rubber. And then the life of the coating will be increased for that period,
                             The protective paint remains on the rubber. Will wash off, fall asleep, peel off after 3 years -
                             It means that for 3 years the service life of liquid rubber has been extended. Do you want more? Restore after 3
                             Year protection. </p>

                        <p> <strong> Aerators </strong> </p>

                        <p> Water vapor, as already mentioned, is a danger to thermal insulation, so from
                            Its bases are covered with a layer of vapor barrier. Meanwhile, even a reliable vapor barrier is not
                            Guarantees 100% protection from steam, it penetrates through it, but in that amount,
                            Which layer of a heater is able to pass through itself. <br/> Further density
                            Waterproofing coating does not allow it to evaporate, and it accumulates in the insulation. AT
                            As a result, the latter loses thermal insulation properties, and on the ceiling of the premises appear
                            Wet spots. In addition, the accumulation of moisture causes swelling of the waterproofing carpet. Water,
                            Freezing at negative temperatures and increasing in volume, tears the waterproofing from
                            Grounds. Temperature changes and mechanical stresses lead to the formation of cracks, and
                            The roof begins to leak. To avoid these troubles, it must be done
                            "Breathing". To do this, install aerators - special devices made of metal or
                            Plastic pipes of different diameters, covered with caps in the form of umbrellas. Aerators evenly
                            Distribute over the entire area of ​​the roof, choosing for them the highest points. These devices
                            Work due to the difference in pressure created by airflows, and output excess
                            Wet vapors from the under-roof space, preventing the formation of bubbles and flaking
                            Roofing material. </p>

                        <p> <strong> Drain </strong> </p>

                        <p> For these funnels, heating is also provided so that they do not freeze in winter. Slopes by
                            Outward direction, to the perimeter of the building, allow to discharge water through downspouts,
                            Fixed on the walls of houses. <br/> Since the flat roof has a slope, with a rain drain
                            Water problems do not arise, but it still has to go somewhere - we need to arrange a drainage system.
                            It can be unorganized and organized. In the latter case,
                            Internal, and external drainage. <br/> Internal drainage in an individual
                            Construction is rarely practiced due to the complexity of the device, unnecessary heat loss and
                            The need to "hide" an additional riser. Often organized is the outer,
                            More familiar with both the device and the further operation. <br/> A characteristic feature
                            Arrangement of gutters of flat roofs is the location of gutters.
                            A predetermined divergence determines the location of their installation (as a ladder in a shower room). In places
                            Slope on the roof surface have rainwater funnels, which are completed
                            Special baskets, catching various garbage. Funnels for the internal gutter
                            Put about in the center of the roof, having drainpipes inside the building, funnels for
                            Outdoor drainage are installed in the parapets. That the water near the funnels is not frozen, but
                            Freely merged into the pipe, around it on the plosha 1 m2 with the help of cable systems perform
                            Heating of the roof. And for the year-round operation of internal gutters, their risers are
                            The entire length) in the heated zone. The cable is laid in and inside the outflow tube of the outer
                            Drainage. Removal of the pipe should be sufficient so that the water from the roof does not fall on the facade
                            At home. <br/> In this case, you can be sure that the icicle will only appear in the winter
                            On the "programmed" you site. Predictability is better than spontaneity, because it means,
                            That you can identify the dangerous places around the house, and this will protect against accidental
                            Injuries. </p>

                        <p> Drains are a kind of indicator of care for the roof. That is, it is periodically necessary
                            Carry out an inspection of spillway funnels, clean them of dirt, leaves, ice, carry out in time
                            Repair or replacement. </p>

                        <p> <strong> Control Zones </strong> </p>

                        <p> The joints of the waterproofing sheets, as well as the places where they join the various elements of the roof, should
                            Be waterproof. This characteristic is provided by reliable sealants. Special attention
                            It is necessary to give sealing of seams, a choice of elements and ways of fastening, through apertures and
                            Technological nodes, which will be subjected to the greatest
                            Exploitation: corners, abutments to pipes and parapets, plums, places of passage
                            Communications, etc. <br/> In the areas of abutment of plates of thermal insulation to the walls of the building and zenith
                            Lanterns of the roof make transitional edges called fillets. This can be a fillet
                            Factory execution, and you can do it yourself, cutting the insulation bar at an angle
                            45 °. <br/> Thermal insulation must be attached to the bearing base mechanically (self-tapping screws
                            To a corrugated board or dowels-umbrellas to ferro-concrete plates), or it is pressed by means of
                            Ballast (pebbles, washed gravel, paving slabs), or glued. In the same way
                            Strengthen and waterproofing. If on the roof (roof) of the house to arrange a lawn or a small flower garden,
                            The function of the protective layer will be performed by the soil. However, such methods are relevant for concrete
                            Bases, for others (the basis from the proflist, on wooden beams), this will be too
                            Heavy "burden", so it is better to use mechanical fastening. </p>
