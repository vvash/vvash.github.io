                        <h2>Flat roofing types</h2>

                        <h3>Traditional</h3>

                        <p>It is a "pie" consisting of a bearing plate with a vapor barrier applied to it,
                            Which is laid insulation. On the insulation is made a mortar with a razuglonkoj, and on
                            This screed is applied with a waterproofing protective carpet made of roll materials.</p>

                        <h3>Inversion</h3>

                        <p>This is an alternative constructive solution to the traditional flat roof. The difference is,
                            That the layer of insulation is not located under the waterproofing carpet, but above it. This
                            The design allows to protect a waterproof carpet from destructive influence
                            UV rays, sudden temperature changes, freeze-thaw cycles, and
                            Mechanical damage. All this increases the service life of such a roof in comparison with
                            Traditional soft roof.</p>

                        <p>The slope of the inversion roof is recommended to be arranged at an angle of 2.5-5%. If the surface
                            It is covered with a layer of gravel, melt and rainwater through the gravel layer flows down through
                            Filter material and flows down the carpet of waterproofing to specially equipped
                            Drainage devices.</p>



                        <h2>Features of insulation</h2>

                        <p>The base of the flat roof is a load-bearing slab, reinforced concrete, monolithic or from a profiled sheet.
                            On top of it is a vapor barrier material, then a layer of thermal insulation.</p>

                        <p>There is a one- and two-layer system of thermal insulation of a flat roof, the latter is used more often:
                            The lower layer thickness of 70-200 mm takes on the basic thermal insulation function, the top layer
                            Thickness of 30-50 mm is responsible mainly for the redistribution of mechanical stress and
                            It is characterized by high compressive strength and density. This "specialization" of the layers
                            "Pie" flat roof can significantly reduce its weight and, accordingly, the load on the
                            Overlap.</p>

                        <h2>Ventilation device</h2>

                        <p>Water vapor, which is constantly formed in the premises of the house, due to diffusion and convective
                            The process rises upward and, by cooling, condenses in the under-roof space,
                            Especially in the winter. Overabundant condensation leads to wet spots and mold
                            On walls and ceiling, and excess moisture, accumulating in heat-insulating material, reduces it
                            Properties. </p>

                        <p>Cope with the condensate can roofing fans (aerators), special pipes of various
                            Diameters of metal or plastic, covered with caps on top in the shape of umbrellas.</p>

                        <p>The principle of the aerator is based on the difference in pressure caused by air currents. Him
                            The design allows moisture vapor to freely flow out from under the roofing carpet, without damaging
                            The latter and preventing the formation of bubbles and flaking of the roofing material.</p>

                        <p>On flat roofs of a simple configuration, aerators are placed evenly over the entire area in
                            The highest points of the roof plane in the places of joints of heat-insulating plates. Their
                            Install better when installing the roof itself.</p>


                        <blockquote><p>There are houses consisting of only one roof, the so-called pyramids. A
                            There are houses where there is no roof, or rather, its usual pitched shape is missing. <br/>
                            The overwhelming part of all projects of country houses assumes use of old kind
                            Technology pitched roof in the form of the letter "A". But is it really necessary? <br/> In Germany and
                            Switzerland has long been in fashion projects of individual buildings with a flat roof. Projects
                            Even use as a coating of the same metal, placed under the
                            A small angle of 5-7%. Thermal insulation fits very simply.</p></blockquote>

                        <p><strong>Steam insulation</strong></p>

                        <p>Before conducting the measures for vapor barrier it is necessary to wait until the screed and the dissolution
                            Completely dry, otherwise the increased humidity and related problems you get in
                            The very beginning of the roofing. <br/> It is necessary to install all engineering equipment,
                            Requiring mechanical fastening. For example, to fix to the bearing plates rainwater funnels,
                            Compensators for expansion joints, branch pipes for the passage of engineering equipment, anchor
                            Bolts. <br/> If on the surface of the screed after the rain there are puddles - this is the first signal that,
                            That the measures taken to arrange the deviations were not carried out correctly, the roof should already be
                            work. In any case, excess water should be removed (manually with rags or a vacuum cleaner - this is
                            Someone as it will), and dry the roof. <br/> Steam insulation is a reinforced
                            Fiberglass bitumen-polymer membrane or vapor barrier film, which is laid
                            Over the screed, and at the edge of the roof, wind up on a vertical plane to a height greater than
                            Height of insulation. The seams are glued with special tape or sealed. Main Function
                            Vapor barrier - protection of the insulation against water vapor coming from inside the house, prevention
                            Its wetting, bloating and guaranteeing the preservation of all the original properties. This happens
                            Because in buildings with a flat roof, as a rule, under the reinforced concrete slab there are always warm
                            Premises. That is, under the roof is always a "+", and over the roof a few months in a year
                            The temperature is always lower, and with the sign "-". <br/> It goes without saying that if
                            The dissection is carried out with the help of heat insulation plates, then the vapor barrier is laid before them.</p>

                        <p><strong>Heater</strong></p>

                        <p>Insulate flat roofs with virtually any insulation. There are types of heaters
                            For flat roofs and for producers of mineral wool, foam and, of course,
                            Extruded polystyrene foam. Which one is more suitable - difficult to say, often
                            The best is the one that is more correctly laid. <br /> But, for example, for warming
                            Only non-hygroscopic materials capable of preserving
                            High thermal insulation characteristics in a moist environment - extruded foams with
                            Closed pores, close to zero water absorption, good heat-shielding
                            Characteristics in a humid environment and sufficient strength. <br/> The thickness of the layer of insulation
                            Depends on the type of flat roof you choose, the thickness of the substrate and the material from which
                            It is executed.</p>

                        <p><strong>Waterproofing</strong></p>

                        <p>Currently, the market for roofing waterproofing materials is: <br/> -
                            Rolled materials based on polyester, fiberglass or bitumen, modified
                            Polymers; <br/> - polymeric membranes; <br/> - bitumen and asphalt mastics; <br/> -
                            Materials based on liquid rubber.</p>

                        <p><strong>Rolling materials</strong></p>

                        <p>The main part of the roofing materials market for flat roofs is occupied by roll products. it
                            Far from that ruberoid of the period of industrial housing construction, and modern
                            High-tech materials from modified bitumen. <br/> Modified by polymers
                            Bitumen roofing materials are characterized by increased resistance to atmospheric
                            Effects, and consequently, a longer one - 20-25 years and even more - a service life.
                            Most often, styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) and atactic
                            Polypropylene plastic (APP). These modifiers have specific properties. APP
                            Gives the roof a resistance to ultraviolet radiation, and SBS - plasticity, which
                            It is especially important for large temperature differences. It is obvious that for climatic conditions
                            Most European countries, including Belarus, are more suitable
                            SBS-modified roofing materials.</p>

                        <p><strong>Polymer membranes</strong></p>

                        <p>In addition to bitumen-polymer roll materials, polymer rolls
                            Materials, for which the term "roofing membranes" is firmly entrenched. It is worth noting that
                            Some other roofing materials are often called membranes. It's connected with
                            Borrowing the term from Western technical literature, where all roofing rolls
                            Materials are called membranes. <br /> Polymer materials form two main groups,
                            Differing in technical and operational characteristics: elastomers and thermoplastics.
                            The elastomers used in the manufacture of roofing materials include manufactured
                            From ethylene-propylene-diene-monomer, and to thermoplastics - from
                            PVC. <br/> Polymer membranes are characterized by higher strength and durability than
                            Bitumen-polymeric materials, elasticity, good resistance to atmospheric phenomena,
                            Oxidation and exposure to ultraviolet rays, as well as frost resistance. However, polymeric
                            Membranes, as a rule, are 20-30% more expensive than bitumen-polymer materials. <br/> Distinctive
                            The feature of polymeric materials is the large width of the membranes. Thanks to this, you can
                            Choose the best option for buildings of all sizes and configurations and thereby reduce
                            Number of joints and seams.</p>



                        <p><strong>Aerators</strong></p>

                        <p>Water vapor, as already mentioned, is a danger to thermal insulation, so from the side
                            Its bases are covered with a layer of vapor barrier. Meanwhile, even a reliable vapor barrier is not
                            Guarantees 100% protection from steam, it penetrates through it, but in that amount,
                            Which layer of a heater is able to pass through itself. <br/> Further density
                            Waterproofing coating does not allow it to evaporate, and it accumulates in the insulation. AT
                            As a result, the latter loses thermal insulation properties, and on the ceiling of the premises appear
                            Wet spots. In addition, the accumulation of moisture causes swelling of the waterproofing carpet. Water,
                            Freezing at negative temperatures and increasing in volume, tears the waterproofing from
                            Grounds. Temperature changes and mechanical stresses lead to the formation of cracks, and
                            The roof begins to leak. To avoid these troubles, it must be done
                            "Breathing". To do this, install aerators - special devices made of metal or
                            Plastic pipes of different diameters, covered with caps in the form of umbrellas. Aerators evenly
                            Distribute over the entire area of ​​the roof, choosing for them the highest points. These devices
                            Work due to the difference in pressure created by airflows, and output excess
                            Wet vapors from the under-roof space, preventing the formation of bubbles and flaking
                            Roofing material.</p>

                        <p><strong>Gutter</strong></p>

                        <p>For these funnels, heating is also provided so that they do not freeze in winter. Slopes by
                            Outward direction, to the perimeter of the building, allow to discharge water through downspouts,
                            Fixed on the walls of houses. <br/> Since the flat roof has a slope, with a rain drain
                            Water problems do not arise, but it still has to go somewhere - we need to arrange a drainage system.
                            It can be unorganized and organized. In the latter case,
                            Internal, and external drainage. <br/> Internal drainage in an individual
                            Construction is rarely practiced due to the complexity of the device, unnecessary heat loss and
                            The need to "hide" an additional riser. Often organized is the outer,
                            More familiar with both the device and the further operation. <br/> A characteristic feature
                            Arrangement of gutters of flat roofs is the location of gutters.
                            A predetermined divergence determines the location of their installation (as a ladder in a shower room). In places
                            Slope on the roof surface have rainwater funnels, which are completed
                            Special baskets, catching various garbage. Funnels for the internal gutter
                            Put about in the center of the roof, having drainpipes inside the building, funnels for
                            Outdoor drainage are installed in the parapets. That the water near the funnels is not frozen, but
                            Freely merged into the pipe, around it on the plosha 1 m2 with the help of cable systems perform
                            Heating of the roof. And for the year-round operation of internal gutters, their risers are
                            The entire length) in the heated zone. The cable is laid in and inside the outflow tube of the outer
                            Drainage. Removal of the pipe should be sufficient so that the water from the roof does not fall on the facade
                            At home. <br/> In this case, you can be sure that the icicle will only appear in the winter
                            On the "programmed" you site. Predictability is better than spontaneity, because it means,
                            That you can identify the dangerous places around the house, and this will protect against accidental
                            Injuries.</p>

                        <p>Drains are a kind of indicator of care for the roof. That is, it is periodically necessary
                            Carry out an inspection of spillway funnels, clean them of dirt, leaves, ice, carry out in time
                            Repair or replacement.</p>
