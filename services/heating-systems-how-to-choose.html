                            <Blockquote> <p> Today the market offers us a lot of modern materials for the device
                            Heating system of a private house. Let's look at the most useful ones. </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <h2> Which boiler should I prefer? </h2>

                        <p> Perhaps the most important component of heating the house is a source of heat, the holy of holies,
                            Which converts energy into heat. Based on the type of energy preferred for heating
                            Dwellings, and it is worth choosing a cauldron. Technologies do not stand still. Modern producers
                            Ready to offer eco-friendly, high-performance and long-life boilers. As a result,
                            Gradually in return for morally obsolete tenu installations using electricity,
                            Induction and electrode boilers arrive, and the place of gas boilers is occupied by condensing boilers.
                            So why pay attention to them when choosing a heating system? </p>


                        <p> <strong> Induction </strong> </p>

                        <p> Converts electricity to heat by electromagnetic induction. In fact - this is a labyrinth
                            Pipes with inductor-tip. The principle of the induction boiler is
                            Transformation of electric power into an electromagnetic field. It heats the core
                            Device, and it in turn transfers excess heat to the heat carrier - water, oil or
                            Ethylene glycol. Rapid heating of the liquid provokes convection currents, which direct
                            Heated coolant up. </p>

                        <p> Induction boilers can use any liquid heat transfer media: water, oil or antifreeze.
                            This is especially important in abnormally cold winters. Hence, if the power of the pipe is cut off
                            Will not burst, and with the restoration of power supply the system will continue to work. </p>

                        <p> Such a construction is durable, because the boiler does not contain any moving parts that
                            Completely eliminates mechanical wear, and microvibration due to magnetic
                            Vibrations, gives 100% protection of the core from scale. Induction boilers are conspicuous
                            They also exceed the devices with their failing heating elements, and
                            Electrode, in which the anode dissolves in a few years. </p>

                        <p> Sellers position induction boilers as capable of saving electricity by consuming
                            At the same heat transfer by 20-30% less analogues. However, do not take this information
                            At face value: any direct heating appliance for generating 1 kWh of thermal energy
                            Spends 1 kW / h of electricity. The only difference is that the efficiency is not affected by dispersion
                            Heat around the boiler, but for this the heat source must be located directly in the
                            Heated room. This is easily achieved, because induction boilers are different
                            Small size and can be mounted in any room. </p>

                        <h2> Electrode </h2>
                        <p> Also the device is direct action. Heating of the coolant in such a device is achieved by
                            Passing an electric current through it. The voltage in the electrodes ionizes
                            Coolant, and the ions move chaotically in it, but no electrolysis is observed, because the cathode and
                            The anode is swapped with the frequency of the electrical network. Since heat energy is generated
                            Directly in the coolant, i.e. The heat carrier is also a heating medium
                            Element, the electrode boiler can save up to 40% of electricity compared to
                            Teen. </p>

                        <p> Electrode boilers are equipped with automatic control, which operates on request. They are missing
                            Heating element, and therefore there is no uncontrolled inertia of heating. As a result,
                            The boiler will produce a heat quantity accurately calibrated to the wattage, which is necessary for the heated
                            Room. Automation regulates the disconnection of the system from the mains in case of a short circuit,
                            Leakage of coolant and excess of the set temperature. Manage this heating system
                            You can even not be at home - via the Internet or by phone. Thanks to satellite communication
                            The boiler can be "called" and "asked" to warm up the room to the desired temperature.
                            Irreplaceable function for owners of country cottages. </p>

                        <p> An essential disadvantage of the electrode boiler is the need for an autonomous connection
                            Power, because when you turn on the device requires a large power of electricity and provokes
                            Voltage jump. </p>

                        <p> Ordinary water can not be a heat carrier in the electrode boiler. We need either substantial
                            Preparation of liquid, or use of a special antifreeze intended for systems
                            Of this type. </p>

                        <p> Electrode boilers, like induction boilers, favorably distinguish compactness and quiet operation.
                            In addition, they can be mounted in an existing system. However, the prices for the devices themselves and
                            The electricity they consume is quite high. </p>

                        <h2> Condensation </h2>

                        <p> Its efficiency is more than 100%. How is this possible, because it contradicts the laws of physics? In addition to
                            Heat from the combustion of gas boiler uses the heat of condensation of water vapor. He is capable
                            Select the energy of the condensate from the combustion products and thereby save fuel. If in
                            Classical gas boilers, the water evolved in the process of burning fuel turns into steam
                            And carried out through the chimney, then in condensation this steam is collected in a special
                            Heat exchanger. The heat thus obtained is then used to heat
                            Coolant, which significantly increases the efficiency of the installation, bringing it to 107-111% in relation to
                            Gas boilers that are not capable of recovering heat from the condensate. </p>

                        <p> For greater savings, it is recommended to connect the boiler to the outdoor temperature sensor. it
                            Will make the return water temperature in the heating system below the dew point (about
                            50 ° C). When included in a low-temperature system, condensing boilers can reduce
                            Gas consumption up to 35% per year and, accordingly, to cut gas costs by 35%. This is quite
                            Compensates for the higher cost of boilers compared to traditional systems. Low
                            The operating temperature makes condensing boilers ideal for a two-circuit system
                            Heating. </p>

                        <p> Using condensation to obtain additional heat also significantly increases
                            Service life of the boiler. After all, condensation from conventional boilers in the chimney and hit
                            Moisture back to the structure causes corrosive wear and deterioration of gas combustion. Details
                            Condensing heat exchanger are made of materials resistant to chemical corrosion,
                            Such as stainless steel and silumin. This makes it possible to extend the service life in half by
                            Compared to conventional gas boilers. </p>

                        <p> For the operation of the condensing boiler, a sealed chimney with forced
                            Extract, resistant to acids. Air and gas are mixed before entering the burner,
                            Due to this and special burner technology, the emission of harmful substances with combustion products
                            Decreases by 80%. Such a high level of ecological compatibility of condensing boilers was
                            The reason for the prohibition in Europe of the use of gas devices at the legislative level. </p>

                        <p> Processes in the system are controlled by automation. On the one hand, it allows more accurate
                            Control switching on and off of the boiler, thereby saving fuel; on the other hand, when
                            Power failure, the boiler will automatically turn off, stopping the burner and
                            Leaving the house without heating. </p>

                        <h2> Radiator or convector? </h2>

                        <p> After installing the boiler it is worth taking care of the heat exchangers, which will deliver heat to each
                            Corner of the house. They can be divided into two large groups: radiators and convectors. So
                            It turned out that the radiators had taken root in the post-Soviet space. They work on
                            Analogy with the sun: up to 80% of the heat is transmitted by radiation in the infrared spectrum and provides
                            Constant temperature in the room. Convectors also form circular flows in the room
                            Warm air. A heating convector consisting of a number of plates placed on
                            A pipe through which air flows, heats the cold air between these plates. Warm air,
                            As is known, is easier, and it tends upward, freeing up space between the plates for a new portion
                            Cold air. So, on which heat exchanger to stop? </p>

                        <p> Of radiators for an autonomous heating system, the most popular
                            Aluminum options. This is the most inexpensive option with high heat output (210 W per section
                            At a standard height), because the metal heats up quickly and gives off heat as quickly
                            Room - for warming up to the desired temperature, it takes 10-12 minutes. Operating pressure
                            The heat exchanger is 16 atmospheres. The low weight of this device facilitates transportation
                            And installation. When using a radiator for heating the room at 10 m? You need only 2 liters of water. Behind
                            The account of a fast warming up of a radiator installation on it of the thermal valve can save up to 30%
                            Energy. </p>

                        <p> But there are aluminum batteries and flaws. These include the instability to corrosion due to
                            High metal activity and a relatively short service life. Operational period
                            Such heat exchangers do not exceed 15 years. To prolong the life of such batteries, you can
                            Use a gentle heat carrier (pH 7-8), necessary to maintain the protective film on
                            The inner surface of the product. When choosing an aluminum radiator, consider:
                            Prefabricated models are not strictly suitable for heating systems that use
                            Antifreeze or any other chemical compound, because they contain rubber
                            Seals. </p>

                        <p> In fact, aluminum radiators from different manufacturers differ only in design -
                            The qualitative characteristics are approximately identical. However, if you see a model, significantly
                            Second in price among analogues, do not rush to run with it to the cashier. Low price differ
                            Models from secondary aluminum. The price, perhaps, is the only advantage of such batteries.
                            Aluminum radiators from recycled materials are less reliable than their counterparts made of
                            For the first time the processed material. </p>

                        <p> Increased strength in comparison with aluminum batteries are bimetallic
                            Radiators. These are the same aluminum heat exchangers, but inside of them is installed a steel
                            The collector, which moves hot water. Accordingly, such a design is more
                            Resistant to corrosion due to steel, which prolongs the service life and increases the resistance
                            Pressure up to 40 atm. At the same time, it retains thermal conductivity akin to aluminum
                            Analogue. Naturally, the price of a bimetallic radiator is higher. </p>

                        <p> Fans of natural air circulation in the premises should consider the installation option
                            Convector. Copper-aluminum convectors are the most resistant to competition in the market.
                            Thanks to copper, the service life of such devices is 50-60 years. The construction of convectors in the root
                            Differs from the design of radiators. If in the radiator batteries the coolant fills
                            All the device, then in the convector - only a tube with fins. This allows you to use the whole
                            From 0.4 to 0.8 liters of coolant. Coupled with high thermal conductivity of aluminum and compact
                            By placing plates this allows to increase the efficiency by more than 50% in comparison with radiators.
                            But in every barrel of honey there is a fly in the ointment. Convector due to its design features
                            Collects dust, and then chases it through the room along with circulating air streams. </p>

                        <p> Another plus of the convector is that the heating element does not come in contact directly with the surface.
                            Therefore, children will not be able to burn themselves on the convector body. In this case, even at low
                            Temperature of the coolant, the room temperature will remain comfortable. </p>

                        <p> The convector will be an indispensable solution for a room with a large glazing surface or
                            Places with high humidity, such as a winter garden, a greenhouse or a swimming pool. </p>

                        <p> Unfortunately, copper-aluminum convectors - a pleasure quite expensive. Expensiveness
                            Is caused by the use of expensive thermoregulatory elements. The price also increases the availability of
                            Decorative screen of wood, stone or stainless steel. So such a "battery" can be
                            Not only as a heating appliance, but also as a piece of furniture that does not need
                            In disguise. You can add another 1 point for aesthetic functionality: installation of a convector
                            Leaves room for special architectural solutions. So, the heater can be
                            Place on the wall, on the floor and even put it in the floor. </p>

                        <h2> The main thing - do not lose with the pipes </h2>

                        <p> Bonding the boiler and the heat exchanger is perhaps the most important stage of installing the heating system
                            System. It is very important to choose the right materials for pipes, because if the radiators,
                            Convectors or even a boiler, if desired, can be replaced without serious consequences, then a replacement
                            Pipes, often built into walls or hidden under the floor, will require a cardinal
                            Reconstruction of the home. </p>

                        <p> The most common type of pipes in heating systems is polypropylene. The main
                            Way, because of its cheapness and reliability of connections. Pipes made of polypropylene more than
                            2 times cheaper than metal-plastic analogs, especially due to connecting parts. At that time
                            The time is just their connection is famous for its durability and ease of installation. Thermal
                            Welding, easily and quickly produced by a conventional soldering iron (as you see, special skills are not
                            Required), allows you to create a monolithic connection, identical in structure to the pipe. </p>

                        <p> To work with metal plastic, expensive tools or physical strength will be needed. But
                            The connection will remain remote from the monolith. Nevertheless, the metal-plastic can be bent, and
                            To create a corner when installing polypropylene pipes, you will have to use the corners and
                            Tees. Polypropylene pipe has a high mechanical strength, so that if
                            Editing accidentally hit it or drop something heavy on it, big trouble will not happen. </p>

                        <p> The guaranteed lifetime of polypropylene is 25 years. Reinforced polypropylene pipes have
                            Operating temperature + 95 ° C, respectively, they can be safely used in heating systems.
                            Another advantage of polypropylene is its resistance to thawing. That is, if the water in the pipe
                            It is frozen, you can not worry about its integrity, it will expand and with thawing will take
                            The original form. </p>

                        <p> The cross-linked polyethylene will be convenient in the application for radial wiring in a screed or the installation of a warm
                            Sex. The material got its name thanks to the structure. The links of ethylene molecules, as it were, are transverse
                            Are sewn into a three-dimensional grid. "Entanglement" of molecules allows polyethylene to remain strong
                            On the fracture and resist cracking, which means it's easy to bend. Also such pipes
                            Have a molecular memory. </p>

                        <p> Ensuring the thermal stability of pressurized material is the main objective
                            Cross-linked polyethylene. Plain polyethylene is not suitable for heating pipes, because it
                            Deforms at high temperatures, while after cross-linking, the recommended
                            Material temperature + 95 ° C. </p>

                        <p> It should be taken into account that cross-linked polyethylene is a material for laying hidden engineering
                            Communications. It can not be used in places where there is sunlight; he
                            Is destroyed by UV radiation. </p>

                        <h2> Innovative solutions in heating systems </h2>
                        <p> We reviewed the most popular and winning materials. But, anyway, they are all -
                            Only modern ways to implement projects, invented dozens and even hundreds of years ago.
                            Now the market presents cardinally new solutions that are designed to significantly reduce
                            Costs and negative impact on the environment. </p>

                        <h3> Warm floor </h3>

                        <p> A warm floor will help reduce heat loss through the roof. Just imagine: with heating
                            Radiators heat in the room is distributed unevenly. As you know, warm air
                            Goes up, which means that if at the height of a person's growth there will be 20 ° C, comfortable for life, then under
                            Ceiling air will warm up to not less than 25 ° C. And the amount of heat leaving through the roof
                            And overlap, depends just on the temperature directly below them. If you turn
                            Floor in the heat source, then when it is heated to 25 ° C, at a height of 2 m the temperature will be
                            23 ° C, and under the ceiling and not more than 20 ° C. So heat loss will be greatly reduced, and
                            The temperature regime will be even higher than from the usual heating radiators. </p>

                        <p> Now there are three technologies for warm floor: water, realized with the help of a heating cable
                            And electric. The first option will be convenient in case of water heating: in the screed
                            A pipe is laid without connections, the temperature of the coolant in which can not exceed
                            40 ° C. Heating cable will be an alternative to the water floor, if the energy of the heating system in
                            The house is recycled from electricity. Such a cable can be laid on the substrate or
                            Fed in the form of heating mats. The film electric floor can be mounted under
                            Laminate, linoleum or tile, because it is a thin dielectric substrate with
                            Applied by current-carrying channels. </p>

                        <h3> Heat storage batteries </h3>

                        <p> Using a heat accumulator, you can save considerably by using for heating
                            Cooler nightly electricity tariff. The heat accumulator is
                            A heat-insulated container of large volume that retains the heated coolant and
                            Gradually gives it to heating appliances. For owners of solid fuel boilers, this is
                            The device is especially useful - the collected heat is enough to heat the boiler no more than once in
                            Day. </p>

                        <h3> Solar collectors </h3>

                        <p> Independent energy supply is not yet widespread in our country. Although both
                            An additional source of saving resources this type of obtaining thermal energy is quite
                            Tempting. The primitive solar collector is a tank of black color, covered with glass
                            Construction. The sun's rays heat the container, and the glass reduces by convection loss
                            Heat. Recently, the most common collectors on vacuum tubes. Principle
                            The action of such a tube is similar to that of a thermos. Such solar cells are converted into
                            Heat 94% of the sun's rays. </p>
                        <p> The collector is not able to provide the house with round-the-clock heating, as there is no sun at night, and in
                            The cloudy weather reduces heat production, but as a source of additional savings
                            May well be considered. In addition, with gas heating, you can use
                            Solar collector to generate electricity - the house of the solar battery is quite enough.
                            By the way, the surplus of electricity received from alternative sources in Belarus can be
                            Surrender to the state at a triple tariff! </p>

                        <h3> Heat Pumps </h3>

                        <p> The heat pump does not depend on the sun, but also does not offer free heating. Furthermore,
                            So far, the prices for operating costs are even higher than if using a backbone
                            gas. The main trump card of this system is independence from non-renewable hydrocarbons. By investing
                            Funds in the heat pump, you can not be afraid of rising gas prices. </p>

                        <p> The pump uses an average kilowatt of electricity, but not for the production of heat, but for
                            Pumping 3-6 kW of heat energy into a housing from another source. Principle of operation of the device
                            Something like a refrigerator, but more often it works for heating. Although heat pumps with
                            The same success can both warm the house in the winter, and cool it in the summer heat. </p>

                        <p> The source of thermal energy can be ground. Pumps using geothermal heat,
                            Are in the upper price segment. At the same time this type of heating is the most reliable and
                            Independent of the climate. Expensive, and the device itself, and installation. After all, the probe-heat exchanger
                            It is necessary to place in the wells drilled for several tens of meters. The temperature there is not
                            Depends on the climate on the surface. Of course, you can place the device horizontally
                            (Below freezing point), so that the soil temperature is 10-12 ° C, but this requires
                            The surface is several times larger than the area of ​​the house. And use it as
                            Homestead is no longer possible: the roots of plants will freeze, because
                            The collector cools the soil very much. </p>

                        <p> The heat exchanger can also be placed in water. This requires either an ice-free
                            Convenient solution, because to obtain an inexhaustible source of heat, it is enough to place in
                            Water heat exchanger and sink it with goods), or a high level of groundwater in
                            Site. In this case, the pump is mounted as follows: two wells are drilled, one of them
                            A pump is installed to draw water, this water passes through the heat exchanger and, giving
                            Heat, is returned through a second well. </p>

                        <p> The closest to the reality of the price of heat pumps are "air-to-air". These protozoa
                            Devices, in fact, inverter air conditioners, complete with a heating cable for
                            Perimeter of the outdoor unit, which prevents frost. The installation instructions are the same as
                            For a conventional air conditioner. But these pumps can be used all year round only in warm
                            Climatic zone, because at a temperature well below zero, they significantly reduce
                            Efficiency, and at -30 ° C and are not at all able to work. </p>
